    Summary jOOQ Framework implementation test
    Version 1.0

A project that uses [jOOQ](http://www.jooq.org) to abstracts the RDBMS and persist data in a generic way independently of the dialect.  
The goal is to give a free choice of database provider and vendor.

So far the project uses Postgres and Tibero as databases.  
The goal is make this project a proof of concept to test if jOOQ guarantees minimal database (and SQL) independence.
