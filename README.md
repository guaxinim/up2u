    Summary jOOQ Framework implementation test
    Version 1.0

A project that uses [jOOQ](http://www.jooq.org) to abstracts the RDBMS and persist data in a generic way independently of the dialect.  
The goal is to give a free choice of database provider and vendor, it's also a proof of concept to test if jOOQ guarantees minimal database (and SQL) independence.  

So far the project uses Postgres and Tibero as databases because these are the vendors requested by project stakeholder.
